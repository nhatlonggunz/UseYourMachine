# Use your machine 

## Introduction
This is an automata application for ALE2 course.
It is an automata version of the LPP's logic UseYourBrain app.

## Current state
Functionalities:
- Parsing files (alphabet, states, finals, transitions)
- Creating Automaton and States.

Todo:
- Check if input is DFA (finish assignment 1)
- Check if a word belongs to the automaton
- Parse test vector.
