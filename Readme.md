# Use your machine 

## Introduction
This is an automata application for ALE2 course.
It is an automata version of the LPP's logic UseYourBrain app.

## Current state
Functionalities:
- Parsing files (alphabet, states, finals, transitions)
- Creating Automaton and States.
    -   ```Hash```, ```operator==```, ```operator<```
- Check if input is DFA (finish assignment 1)
- Parse test vector. 
- Check if a word belongs to the automaton (finish assignment 2)
- Display automaton graph.

Todo: 
- Handle the case where some test vector fields is not present 
- Parsing regular expression
- Unit Test
